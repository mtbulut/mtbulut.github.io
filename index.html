                    <h2>Elliptic curve</h2>
                    In mathematics, an elliptic curve is a plane algebraic curve defined by an equation of the form

                    which is non-singular; that is, the curve has no cusps or self-intersections. (When the coefficient field has characteristic 2 or 3, the above equation is not quite general enough to comprise all non-singular cubic curves; see § Elliptic curves over a general field below.)

                    Formally, an elliptic curve is a smooth, projective, algebraic curve of genus one, on which there is a specified point O. An elliptic curve is an abelian variety – that is, it has a multiplication defined algebraically, with respect to which it is an abelian group – and O serves as the identity element. Often the curve itself, without O specified, is called an elliptic curve; the point O is often taken to be the curve's "point at infinity" in the projective plane.

                    <h2>Elliptic curves over the real numbers</h2>
                    <img id = "my_img" src="img/ec.png"/>
                    Although the formal definition of an elliptic curve is fairly technical and requires some background in algebraic geometry, it is possible to describe some features of elliptic curves over the real numbers using only introductory algebra and geometry.

                        In this context, an elliptic curve is a plane curve defined by an equation of the form

                        <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b}}" border="0"/>
                        <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b)" border="0"/> 
                        where a and b are real numbers. This type of equation is called a Weierstrass equation.

                        The definition of elliptic curve also requires that the curve be non-singular. Geometrically, this means that the graph has no cusps, self-intersections, or isolated points. Algebraically, this holds if and only if the discriminant
                        <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{\Delta =-16(4a^{3}+27b^{2})}" border="0"/>
                        <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Delta =-16(4a^{3}+27b^{2})" border="0"/>  
                        is not equal to zero. (Although the factor −16 is irrelevant to whether or not the curve is non-singular, this definition of the discriminant is useful in a more advanced study of elliptic curves.)

                        The (real) graph of a non-singular curve has two components if its discriminant is positive, and one component if it is negative. For example, in the graphs shown in figure to the right, the discriminant in the first case is 64, and in the second case is −368.

                    If y2 = P(x), where P is any polynomial of degree three in x with no repeated roots, the solution set is a nonsingular plane curve of genus one, an elliptic curve. If P has degree four and is square-free this equation again describes a plane curve of genus one; however, it has no natural choice of identity element. More generally, any algebraic curve of genus one, for example from the intersection of two quadric surfaces embedded in three-dimensional projective space, is called an elliptic curve, provided that it has at least one rational point to act as the identity.

Using the theory of elliptic functions, it can be shown that elliptic curves defined over the complex numbers correspond to embeddings of the torus into the complex projective plane. The torus is also an abelian group, and in fact this correspondence is also a group isomorphism.
